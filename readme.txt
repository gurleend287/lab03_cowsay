COP3504C - Lab03: The Cow Says...
Overview: This lab is designed to introduce students to the Bash Command Line Interface (CLI) and the concept of CLI
          arguments and give them practice writing classes. For (only) this lab, you are not allowed to use any windowed
          editor (such as IntelliJ, Eclipse, or Notepad++). Instead, you will use a Unix-based command line editor.

The command line arguments that must be supported are as follows:
    python3 cowsay.py -l                Lists the available cows
    python3 cowsay.py MESSAGE           Prints out the MESSAGE using the default COW
    python3 cowsay.py -n COW MESSAGE    Prints out the MESSAGE using the specified COW
